# LabGym Zoo

The LabGym Zoo contains pre-trained Detector and Categorizer models as well as behavior examples that were used to train these models. You can use pre-trained models to develop your own models with much less data, leveraging the benefits of transfer learning. You can also use the behavior examples as benchmarking datasets to develop, refine and evaluate tools. We hope that the LabGym Zoo helps to foster collaborative dialogues in the community. We also envision that teachers and students will use the database for education in behavioral analysis. Instructions on how to contribute to the LabGym Zoo will be added soon.
