# Code of Conduct for LabGym Contributors

## Our Pledge

LabGym is developed with a focus on accessibility. We strive to expand access to behavioral research technology for all, encompassing both academic researchers and the broader public of various backgrounds and resources. The LabGym initiative welcomes contributions from diverse backgrounds and values a wide range of skills and perspectives. With this goal in mind, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all contributors to agree and adhere to these guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community for all.

## Guidelines Overview

* All participants must feel safe, regardless of their diverse backgrounds (including family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race, ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity).
* This code applies to all LabGym activities, including offline and online interactions, public representations, and community forums.

## Expected Behaviors

* **Respect:** Value differing viewpoints, be open to being wrong, and maintain civility in all discussions.
* **Professionalism:** Speak honestly and directly, respecting others even during disagreements.
* **Inclusivity:** Encourage diverse perspectives and voices, particularly from less dominant group members.
