# LabGym Model Zoo

This page contains several pre-trained Detector and Categorizer models that can be used in your own analysis. These models should reduce the time needed to complete an analysis,
and they can also be used to more quickly train models on new animals via transfer learning. Instructions on how to contribute models to the LabGym Model Zoo will be added at a
later date.
